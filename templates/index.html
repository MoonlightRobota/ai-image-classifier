          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            The Visual Impairment Helper Dog Project is a collaborative effort
            to create a device that enhances the mobility and independence of
            visually impaired individuals. The project focuses on developing a
            wearable device that utilizes sensors and advanced algorithms to
            detect obstacles, navigate environments, and provide audio feedback
            to the user.

          <h2>Progress</h2>
          <p>
            The project is currently in the development phase, with a prototype
            being tested in controlled environments. Initial feedback has been
            positive, and further improvements are being made to enhance the
            device's functionality and usability.
