          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Our project focuses on creating a wearable device that uses sensors
            and advanced algorithms to detect obstacles, navigate environments,
            and provide audio feedback to the user. This technology aims to
            enhance the daily lives of visually impaired individuals by
            providing them with greater spatial awareness and autonomy.

          <h2>Goals</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Develop a device that detects obstacles in the user's path.</li>
            <li>
              Implement navigation features for safe guidance through
              environments.
            </li>
            <li>Provide audio feedback to enhance spatial awareness.</li>
            <li>Create a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.</li>

          <h2>Progress</h2>
          <p>
            Currently, we are in the development phase, testing a prototype in
            controlled environments. Initial feedback has been positive, and we
            continue to improve the device's functionality and usability.

          <h2>Our Innovation: The Robot Dog</h2>
          <p>
            We have built a robot dog equipped with a camera that detects
            objects, assisting people with visual impairments. Our robot dog is
            designed to be a reliable companion, providing assistance and
            support to those who need it most. Join us in making a meaningful
            impact at the UCLA Hackathon 2024!
